2048 is a command-line implementation of the hacker-pop-culture boardgame by
the same name.

The goal of the game is to combine tiles of the same number until one creates
the "2048" tile. The entire board may be moved by using either "wasd" (standard
gaming movement keys) or "hjkl" (vim keys). Use Ctrl+C (SIGINT) to exit. Use
"?" to display a help message.
